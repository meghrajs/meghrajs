# Meghraj Singh — SDET / QA Automation Engineer (Automation + Backend-Aware Quality)

I build reliable automation systems across UI + API layers with a strong focus on CI/CD, debuggability, and stable releases.  
I also work hands-on in **Laravel/PHP** to improve testability, build internal tooling, and validate complex backend flows (webhooks, billing, audit trails).

📌 **Start here:** https://github.com/meghrajs/sdet-portfolio

## What I deliver
- ✅ Maintainable automation frameworks (clean patterns, stable selectors, reusable utilities)
- ✅ Flaky-test reduction (smart waits, retries strategy, deterministic test data)
- ✅ Trustworthy CI pipelines (fast feedback, artifacts, traceability, repeatable runs)
- ✅ Strong observability (logs, screenshots, traces, structured debugging)
- ✅ Backend-aware testing (Laravel + MySQL + webhooks) to test deeper and debug faster
